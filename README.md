News site project using flex box and css grid 

## The problem

### Put in practice material from online websites:
* Box-sizing
* Position:relative and position:absolute
* grid-template-columns: repeat (4, minmax(auto,1fr))
top left and right corners of img having also border-radius in accordance to figure having border-radius
* 2 distinct groups in navbar for further styling using flex
* hyperlinks within a page for user-experience
user-agent stylesheet overiding own styling- use * for own default from beginning next time
* grid-area for each grid nth-child on each viewport
* Started with desktop viewport like Technigo Annika video but mobile-first is best-practice
* Content not primordial if getting stuck but Google bard used (have to understand how to train the machine)
* under 400px screen width, elements unaligned - hamburger menu to be used next time

### If given more time/to explore: 
* mobile-first
* layout automation without media queries i.e. hero and grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(320px,1fr)).  Ux-designers do not bother viewport lesser than 320px
* carousel css animation
* hamburger menu for mobile viewport only
* flip card css animation with backface-visibility:hidden
* 3d-layout with z-index for "scroll back to top button" or position-fixed for navbar
