News site project using flex box and css grid 

## The problem

Discovered:
Box-sizing
Position:relative and position:absolute
grid-template-columns: repeat (4, minmax(auto,1fr))
top left and right corners of img must have border-radius if figure has one
2 distinct groups in navbar for further styling
hyperlinks within a page for user-friendly approach
user-agent stylesheet overiding own styling- use * for own default next time
Started with desktop viewport like Technigo Annika video but mobile-first is recommended
Content not that primordial if getting stuck - Jennie, contrary - Diego- Google bard used (have to understand how to train the machine)
under 400px screen width, elements unaligned
If given more time/to explore: 
mobile-first
layout automation without media queries i.e. hero and grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(320px,1fr)).  Ux-designers do not bother viewport lesser than 320px
carousel css animation
hamburger menu for mobile viewport only
flip card css animation with backface-visibility:hidden
