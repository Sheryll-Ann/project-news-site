# News Site

Your task is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further, the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop-sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

**What you need to do**
* Style your page.
* Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to layout the page.
* Create a responsive design with the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.
* The site should have a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles.
* Play around with hover effects, i.e. change colors, add or remove borders or flip the image upside down.

**Stretch goals**
- Add a box-shadow to make the photos look like polaroids
- Align the cards to the centre of the page
- Add some CSS animations to your project


## The problem

### Put in practice material from online websites:
* Box-sizing
* Position:relative and position:absolute
* grid-template-columns: repeat (4, minmax(auto,1fr))
* top left and right corners of img having also border-radius in accordance to figure having border-radius
* 2 distinct groups in navbar for further styling using flex
* hyperlinks within a page for user-experience
* user-agent stylesheet overiding own styling- use * for own default from beginning next time
* scroll up to top page button added with position-fixed and z-index
* grid-area for each grid nth-child on each viewport
* Started with desktop viewport but mobile-first is best-practice
* Content not primordial if getting stuck but Google bard used (not efficient- have to understand how to train the machine)
* under 400px screen width, elements unaligned (hamburger menu or scroll-down menu to be used next time)

### If given more time/to explore: 
* mobile-first
* layout automation without media queries i.e. hero and grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(320px,1fr)).  Ux-designers do not bother viewport lesser than 320px
* carousel css animation
* hamburger menu for mobile viewport only
* flip card css animation with backface-visibility:hidden
